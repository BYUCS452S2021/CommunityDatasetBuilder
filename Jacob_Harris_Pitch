Hey Sam my name is Jacob Harris and I think this is a great idea! After
taking CS 474 I know that sometimes finding a dataset for a specific project
can be difficult. DynamoDB through AWS may work well here with the partition
key as the name of the dataset.

I have some experience with DynamoDB from CS 340 and have some familiarity
with Vue from CS 260. It has been awhile though so I would need to brush up.
Feel free to reach out to me on Slack or email me at jth8000@gmail.com

Thanks!

Jacob
