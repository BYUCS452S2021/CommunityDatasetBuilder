# CommunityDatasetBuilder


## Project description
One of the most difficult parts of supervised deep and machine learning projects is finding labeled data. Though there are many sites that contain finished datasets, such as kaggle.com, there are no sites that let communities build unique datasets together. The idea of this project is to build a site that lets communities come together and build labeled data sets. Example features would include creating a dataset, uploading data, labeling data, and validating labels on data. This project would be fairly simple to complete, but also meaningful.
